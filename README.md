# HTML Portfolio

Welcome to my **HTML Portfolio** repository!  
This repository contains a collection of simple projects that I created using pure HTML as part of my learning journey in web development.

## 📁 What’s Inside?

- Multiple folders, each representing a different mini HTML project.
- Every folder includes:
  - The HTML source code.
  - A preview of the project (either as an image or a live demo link).
  - A short description explaining the purpose of the project.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A way to document my progress in learning HTML.
- A personal portfolio showcasing my front-end development practice.
- A reference for anyone who wants to learn how to build static web pages from scratch.

## 🌐 Live Demo (if available)

If any live previews are available via GitHub Pages, links will be added below each project folder.

Feel free to explore, give feedback, or use any part of these projects as a learning reference!
